      <h2 class="new">Climate change and the environmental crisis are some of the most threatening problems that humanity faces.</h2>
      <br>
      <p class="main-text">Climate change includes both global warming driven by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases and the resulting large-scale shifts in weather patterns. Temperature rise on land is about twice the global average increase, leading to desert expansion and more common heat waves and wildfires. Temperature rise is also amplified in the Arctic, where it has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss. Warmer temperatures are increasing rates of evaporation, causing more intense storms and weather extremes. Impacts on ecosystems include the relocation or extinction of many species as their environment changes, most immediately in coral reefs, mountains, and the Arctic. Climate change threatens people with food insecurity, water scarcity, flooding, infectious diseases, extreme heat, economic losses, and displacement. These human impacts have led the World Health Organization to call climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="main-text">Another very serious, timeless and closely related issue is the wildfires. Leading natural causes of wildfires include: global warming, dry climate, lightning, and volcanic eruption.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="main-text">Air pollution is the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane, carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution may cause diseases, allergies and even death to humans; it may also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Both human activity and natural processes can generate air pollution</p>
      <br>
      <p class="main-text">Marine pollution occurs when substances used or spread by humans, such as industrial, agricultural and residential waste, particles, noise, excess carbon dioxide or invasive organisms enter the ocean and cause harmful effects there. Since most inputs come from land, either via the rivers, sewage or the atmosphere, it means that continental shelves are more vulnerable to pollution. Air pollution is also a contributing factor by carrying off iron, carbonic acid, nitrogen, silicon, sulfur, pesticides or dust particles into the ocean. The pollution often comes from nonpoint sources such as agricultural runoff, wind-blown debris, and dust. Land and air pollution have proven to be harmful to marine life.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="new">This is where technology comes in.</h2>
      <br>
      <p class="main-text">The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the growing network of internet-connected devices in our lives today. One of the key advantages of the IoT is the ability to monitor all your devices' activity. This function is where it can help sustainability. Using IoT-enabled appliances can help cut down energy waste. You can set lights and air conditioning or heating units to turn off automatically after a specific time, or shut them off remotely while you're away. The IoT can also help companies track and then improve the lifecycle of their products.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="main-text">Batteries are nothing new, but they are getting far more efficient. In the past, energy sources like solar power have been ineffective due to the challenges that come with storing the energy they generate. Modern battery systems such as Tesla's Powerwall make it possible for people and businesses to store and use power in a much less wasteful manner.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="main-text">Agriculture takes up a lot of land, but it doesn't have to. Indoor farms are more efficient than traditional ones and don't use nearly as much land, reducing habitat destruction. Using climate control technology, indoor farms can produce seasonal crops all year. As the population increases, this versatility could prove vital. People will always need agriculture, but we are running out of space.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="main-text">Much like with solar panels, older electric cars were impractical and overpriced. However, with advances in automotive technology, electric vehicles are now a perfectly viable option. Manufacturers like Tesla and BMW are not only making electric cars more efficient, but also more affordable. As time goes on, these technologies will only grow cheaper and more effective.</p>
